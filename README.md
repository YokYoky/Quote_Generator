# Quote_Generator
The reason i made this is to motivate myself.

Generate random quotes

1) let user input any key except enter(must not be empty)

2) array to store quotes (api for future development)

3) use random to randomize the array

4) only print 1 index of array


additional ideas for future development

1) use quotes api

2) (GUI) javafx or swing
